This repository provides:
- the scripts to create the latest version of GIMP from PPAs and JuNest (Arch Linux);
- unofficial AppImages of GIMP Stable and GIMP Developer Edition.

Continuous builds based on JuNest are released each Sunday, you can download them from:

***https://github.com/ivan-hc/GIMP-appimage/releases/tag/continuous***

Other Debian/Ubuntu/PPA based AppImages are available too among the [releases](https://github.com/ivan-hc/GIMP-appimage/releases)

# How to integrate GIMP AppImage into the system
The easier way install at system level the AppImages is to use "AM", alternativelly you can use "AppMan" to install them locally and without root privileges. Learn more about:
- "AM" https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM-application-manager
- AppMan https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM-application-manager

or visit the site ***https://portable-linux-apps.github.io***

-------------------------
## Why JuNest over PPAs?
JuNest-based AppImages have more compatibility with much older systems. 

Compiling these so-called "ArchImages" is easier and the Arch Linux base is a guarantee of continuity being one of the most important GNU/Linux distributions, supported by a large community that offers more guarantees of continuity, while usually unofficial PPAs are mantained by one or two people and built as a third-party repository for Ubuntu, a distro that is more inclined to push Snaps as official packaging format instead of DEBs.
